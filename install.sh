The following options are supported by pkg: -v, --version 	 Display the current version of pkg. -d, --debug 	 Show debug	information. -l, --list 	 List all the available command names, and exit without performing 	 any other action.	The -v option takes precedence over -l but -l 	 will override any other command line arguments. -o	,	--option 	 Set configuration option for pkg from the command line. Options 	 that are set from the environment are redefined. It is permitted 	 to	specify	this option multiple times. -N	 Activation	status check mode. Prevent pkg	from automatically 	 creating or initializing the SQLite database in 	 /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite if it does not already exist. 	 Prevent pkg from performing any actions if	no packages are	cur- 	 rently installed, on the basis that a correctly initialised sys- 	 tem using pkg will	always have at least the pkg package itself 	 registered. 	 If	used without any other arguments, pkg -N will run the sanity 	 tests and if successful print out a short message showing how 	 many packages are currently installed. The exit status should be 	 a reliable	indication of whether a	system is configured to	use 	 pkg as its	package	management system or not. 	 Example usage: 		 if	pkg -N >/dev/null 2>&1;	then 		 # pkgng-specifics 		 else 		 # pkg_install-specifics 		 fi 	 The -N flag was first released in the /usr/sbin/pkg bootstrapper 	 in	FreeBSD	8.4, but was missing from FreeBSD 9.1.	It may not be 	 enough to just call pkg -N, as the	bootstrapper may be invoked, 	 or	an error returned from pkg. The following script is the 	 safest way	to detect if pkg is installed and activated: 		 if	TMPDIR=/dev/null ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=yes \ 			 PACKAGESITE=file:///nonexistent \ 			 pkg info -x 'pkg(-devel)?$' >/dev/null 2>&1; then 		 # pkgng-specifics 		 else 		 # pkg_install-specifics 		 fi -j	, --jail 	 pkg will execute in the given , where name 	 matches ``jls name'' and id matches ``jls jid''. See jail(8) and 	 jls(8). -c	, --chroot	 	 pkg wi
